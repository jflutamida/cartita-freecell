# cartita-freecell
A freecell card game using Microsoft's game numbering system. Written in C++ and Gtkmm.
The UI is keyboard driven (no mouse support game) with the commands similar as those implemented in the legendary FCPro Windows game: 1 to 8 for columns, A to D for the four freecells, H for home.
